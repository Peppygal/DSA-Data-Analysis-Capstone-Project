## Kultra Mega Stores Inventory Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

This project involves performing data-driven analysis on the KMS Superstore dataset using SQL to generate actionable business insights. The goal is to evaluate customer behavior, product performance, regional trends, and operational efficiency through a series of questions categorized into two case scenarios.
By examining this data, we aim to support strategic decision-making around inventory, pricing, and marketing efforts to drive growth and improve profitability.
The analysis focuses on helping the KMS management team understand where the business is thriving, what areas need improvement, and how strategic decisions can be supported through data.
